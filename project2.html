				Transgender Suicide: What can We do to Help?
			</p>
			<h2>
				Project Objective:
			</h2>
			<p>
				<span style="width:36pt; display:inline-block">&#xa0;</span>The goal of this proposal is to discover more information from what is contributing to increased suicide rates among transgender (trans) individuals. To contribute to this goal, I would like to survey the campus’ trans population. Questions will be focused on mental state, generalized causes, and most importantly, getting help. It is important to understand what services are needed or preferred, whether that be easier therapy, trans specific helplines, or some other solution. The best way to determine people’s preference and accessibility is to ask them.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Project Background and Significance: 
			</h2>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt">
				The suicide ideation rates for the general population in the United States are 4.8% and suicide attempts are at 0.6%. For transgender individuals, these numbers are 81.7% and 40.4% (Liu, Hui, and Lindsey Wilkinson). As a minority, transgender individuals seem to be predisposed to mental instability. This is the result of many factors. From bullying to shaming from a young age to society shunning them as an adult, it can be hard for anyone to get a strong foothold in life. Being trans only makes it more confusing and challenging. According to a report from Geoffrey L Ream, transgender suicides in ages 11-29 increased from 2014 to 2019 from 2.0% to 6.5% of national suicides. Seeing that the problem is getting worse, understanding the problem and formulating a solution seems more and more important. 
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt">
				A report by Jack L Turban determined having access to gender affirming care has a positive result in mental health compared to adults wanting and not receiving gender affirming care. Receiving care as an adult has similar effects, but less so than in adolescence. This shows how trans individuals being comfortable in their own skin by receiving care can greatly increase their mental health, bringing them closer to the average mental health challenges of the average individual.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent:36pt">
				A major issue in gender affirming care, and in general healthcare, is a plain lack of proper knowledge or trust from healthcare services. According to a report by Thompson-Blum and Daniel N, transgender individuals who are transitioning have a higher chance to avoid emergency services when they need them. Trans individuals who have stronger social support are less likely to avoid emergency services. This fear of being treated badly stems from society’s bias against trans people, and the existence of transphobia. Teaching standard for treating trans people medically also could help. Many doctors have not been informed and taught needs of trans people and risks of transitioning, or dangers of taking the medication incorrectly. Recommendations and guidance is being developed for these cases, but have not been fully integrated (Pratt-Chapman, Mandi L., et al.).

			<h2>
				Research Methods: 
			</h2>
			<p>
				<span style="width:36pt; display:inline-block">&#xa0;</span>The survey needs to be designed first. It will have four sections: basic demographics, mental health, causes of mental health, and how they get help. Basic demographics consists of whether they are a transman or transwoman, age, and race. Mental health will ask the subject typical questions used to gain a basic understanding of depression and suicide, using questions from PHQ-9. It also needs to ask about mental health history. Causes will ask about family and friends, probing for bullying as a child, or negative friendships. It also will ask about what kind of place they lived in and other large contributors to depression. The final part, how to get help, will ask if they have gotten help, if they want help, and why they haven’t gotten help. Ask specifically about what they would want to feel more comfortable with getting help, such as specific trans hotlines or a texting number.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="width:36pt; display:inline-block">&#xa0;</span>After creating the survey, it needs to be distributed. To both reach out to a hidden minority and collect the data afterwards, printing flyers with a QR code to a survey website is optimal. The specific website will be Google Forms, due to its flexibility and ability to verify double entries.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="width:36pt; display:inline-block">&#xa0;</span>After the data is collected, it will need to be parsed to determine what is needed from different kinds of people, and what has worked for people in the past.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Expected Outcome: 
			</h2>
			<p>
				<span style="width:36pt; display:inline-block">&#xa0;</span>After data is collected, there is not much that can be done past release findings and conclusions. Helping trans people is a slow process that takes one step at a time, and all that can be done in this step is obtain more valuable information that will help create more solutions to the problem that work. Without this data, services simply cannot do better in helping people, and the suicide rate of trans people will continue following its upward trend. The hope is that by releasing the conclusions to different services and hotlines and such, other people who are already trying to help these people can adjust and succeed more.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Preliminary Work and Experience:
			</h2>
			<p>
				<span style="width:36pt; display:inline-block">&#xa0;</span>I have previously written papers researching trans suicide rates and causes of them. With this collected research, I have a better understanding of what is needed and expected in the situation. I am personally also trans, and have several close friends who are also trans. With my experience, I was shocked to find out only 4.8% of the general population have suicide ideation (Liu, Hui, and Lindsey Wilkinson). I am predisposed genetically for depression, take prescribed medication for depression, and work with several other people who are diagnosed with depression. With this prior experience and knowledge, I know what to expect from someone like me, but that does not mean I am unbiased. Every trans person I know is depressed, but I need to make sure I understand not every trans person is like the people I know. Avoiding bias is always difficult, but with the understanding that it is there, bias can be minimized.

				IRB/IACUC Statement: 
			</h2>
			<p>
				<span style="width:36pt; display:inline-block">&#xa0;</span>As the proposal is a survey involving contact with human subjects, IRB approval will be required. No animals will be involved, so IACUC approval is unnecessary.
