    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:17.5pt; margin-left:-.25pt'>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:17.5pt; margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>I am seeking employment as a sales associate at the Office Depot at 7174 West Colonial Drive in Orlando, Florida, as detailed in a post on Indeed.com. Working previously as a sales associate, I have previously demonstrated the ability to learn quickly and fulfill duties assigned, having experience in stocking, cashiering, and maintaining upkeep of the store floor.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:17.5pt; margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>My prior experience was my first job, and taught me many skills required for working as a sales associate. I learned to use Zebra scanners to identify items, and was taught how to determine the sections they belong in based on the number alone. This allows me to use the device to locate items for customers and restock products on the floor. I was also taught to inventory stock using the Zebra device, allowing products to be put in top-stock and still easily located. I personally very much enjoyed organizing and sorting the store, making it look more presentable in the process. I also gained experience in cashiering and customer service, helping customers find the solutions they are looking for. I gained confidence in my money counting abilities, and providing customers guidance.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:16.3pt; margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'>As previously stated, I am applying to be a sales associate at Office Depot at 7174 West Colonial Drive in Orlando, Florida. My resume has been included with this letter, and I can be contacted either by phone with (321)-474-5324, or by email by <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b5d6d4d9c3dcdb9bd6ddd4c7d9d0c69bddd0c7d8d4dbf5d2d8d4dcd99bd6dad8">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Thank you for your consideration for my application.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.45pt; margin-left:36.5pt'>Sincerely,</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:17.5pt; margin-left:72.5pt'>Calvin Herman</p>
