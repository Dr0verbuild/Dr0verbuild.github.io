				<h1>Interview Questions</h1>
					<div class="WordSection1">
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Tell me about yourself. / Walk me through your resume.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='line-height:125%'>●<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> I am working on a bachelor's degree in software engineering. I have already achieved my associates in arts. I have previously worked as a sales associate and completed similar duties as required for this job as well. My resume details the experience I gained from working at Office Depot previously. I would like to note I enjoy inventory and stocking product very much, with it and helping customers giving me a soothing and interesting purpose.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Tell me about a time where you had to deal with conflict. What was the conflict and how did you handle it?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='line-height:125%'>●<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> A customer was looking for a single booklet of receipt papers, but we only sold them in packs of eight. I attempted to inform them that they could order a single booklet online for the same price, so it would be better to just buy the 8, and have the rest for later. They insisted that last time they needed the booklet, they were able to buy a single one, and had no need for another 7. I was not able to convince her that the best option was to buy the pack, since a single would still cost the same thing, so another coworker came over to give them a different face to talk to so that they could be talked down from their frustrated mood. Sometimes the best thing to do to solve a problem is to step back and let someone more capable and in a better position handle it, as the customer would likely not be able to calm down unless a different face explained the situation.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Tell me about a time when you worked on multiple projects. How did you prioritize?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='line-height:125%'>●<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> I have had multiple software projects due at the same time. In order to get them done efficiently, I wrote out a plan on how I would solve the problems and write the programs, and did the simpler one first.</p>
