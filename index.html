					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>
						I have achieved an Associates in Arts at Eastern Florida State College in 2023, 
						and am progressing in a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida (UCF). 
						My goal is to create programs to entertain or help people, such as games and tools. 
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Employment History</h3>
					<p>
						I have worked at Office Depot as a sales associate, the entry level job for the store. While my time was short due to 
						moving to UCF, I learned about many skills, such as talking to customers, running a cash register, stocking, and taking inventory. 
						I found a large amount of enjoyment in assisting customers and organizing inventory.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Skills</h3>
					<p>
						I have experience in Office products such as Word and Excel, and enjoy managing spreadsheets. I also have begineer experience programming in C++ and Java. 
						I am also learning how to use Blender to create 3D models and animations. I am learning Godot Engine and Unity to create small projects.
					</p>

					<h1 style="text-align: center">Reflection</h1>
					<p>
						The portfolio is progressing well, and I am making progress in making it look more professional. I am quite happy with the page layout, nav bar, and colors. 
						I do have some concerns regarding the colors however, as they do not quite seem right. I used a color palette generator to attempt to make colors that blend, 
						but there is still something wrong. As for the nav bar, I am still trying to figure out the sizing for the font in order to center it properly. 
						There are no custom fonts yet, so readability is not a concern. I plan on adding some for headers, but leaving text as is. I have been reminded by this project as 
						to how difficult and tedious web design is.
					</p>
					<p>
						I find understanding what is seen as professional difficult. I often find websites bloated and clunky, with animations wasting time and making navigation a chore. 
						Because of this bias, I tend to favor simpler websites, but worry that they are too basic. In order to manage color schemes, I found a color palette generator to 
						create a cohesive palette, but need to work a bit on making it flow properly. The only questions I have are related to what professional means and whether I am 
						meeting expectations.
